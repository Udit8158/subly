"""Structured event stream for GUI / machine consumers.

The CLI normally prints human-friendly progress with `rich`. A desktop app (or
any other program) instead wants a stable, machine-readable stream. When the
CLI is run with `--json`, every meaningful step emits one JSON object per line
to stdout, e.g.:

    {"type": "chunk_start", "t": 1718370000.12, "index": 3, "total": 12, ...}

This module is the single source of truth for that contract. The same event
names/fields are produced by the real pipeline and by `--simulate`, so a UI can
be built and tested against the simulated stream without ever running a model
or calling an API.

Design rules:
- One JSON object per line on stdout, flushed immediately (so a reader sees
  events live, not buffered).
- Every event has `type` (str) and `t` (unix seconds, float).
- Unknown/extra fields are allowed; consumers should ignore what they don't
  understand. New event types may be added over time — treat them as optional.

Event types (payload fields beyond type/t):
  run_start         video, output, whisper_model, openai_model, notes, chunk_minutes
  audio_ready       duration            (seconds, float)
  plan              total, chunks:[{index,start,end}]
  estimate          est_usd, est_seconds
  model_download_start    kind("transcribe"), model, repo, location
  model_download_progress kind, completed_bytes, total_bytes, percent
  model_download_done     kind, location, seconds
  chunk_start       index, total, start, end, overall_pct, eta_seconds
  stage_start       index, stage("transcribe"|"translate")
  transcribe_progress index, done, total   (done/total = audio frames seeked)
  transcribe_done   index, lines, seconds, peak_gb
  translate_progress index, done, total
  translate_done    index, lines, seconds
  chunk_done        index, total, seconds, overall_pct, eta_seconds
  cached            index, scope("audio"|"transcribe"|"translate"|"both")
  run_done          output, ja_lines, en_lines, seconds
  error             stage, message, fatal(bool)
